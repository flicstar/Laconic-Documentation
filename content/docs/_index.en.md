Here you will find the documentation for the Laconic Network. Documentation will be released as components become ready for use and as opportunities arise for developers and validators to participate in building and testing the network. 

The following sections provide overviews of the relevant roles:

* [DApp Developers]({{< ref "/docs/dapp-developers" >}} "Developers")
* [Service Providers]({{< ref "/docs/service-providers" >}} "Service Providers")
* [Validators]({{< ref "/docs/validators" >}} "Validators")
* [Laconic Network Members]({{< ref "/docs/members" >}} "Laconic Network Members")
