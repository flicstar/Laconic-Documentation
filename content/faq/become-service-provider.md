Service Providers may or may not be validators. These are the parties who run Watchers and serve data to end-users. For any given Watcher, Service Providers will form a Federated Cache. In the Service Provider Marketplace, Watcher Publishers will be matched with Service Providers, who will form the Federated Cache for that Watcher.
