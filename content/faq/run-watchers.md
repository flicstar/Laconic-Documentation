Service Providers run watchers by serving data to end users, as part of a federated cache. In the Service Provider Marketplace, Watcher Publishers will be matched with Service Providers, who will form the Federated Cache for that Watcher. When the Federated Cache for that Watcher serves the data to an end-user, the end-user pays a fee that covers the Federated Cache’s fee (which is set in the Service Provider Marketplace between the Watcher Publisher and the Service Provider) as well as the Watcher Publisher’s fee, to use their Watcher. The data is validated by the Federated Cache members.
