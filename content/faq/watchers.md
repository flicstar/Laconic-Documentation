Watchers are customized queries of blockchain data (including specific views of blockchain state and data expressed as mini-blockchains) written against specific smart contracts. They make verifiable copies of Ethereum data more available to DApp end users by connecting to ipld-eth-servers, each other, and browsers via GraphQL over HTTPS, WebSockets, or WebRTC. DApp developers can access these custom data transformations via the Watcher registry, a marketplace that facilitates the registration and discovery of Watchers. Furthermore, DApps use Watchers to fetch, cache, and query their DApp’s data, while Laconic coordinates with the Watchers to scale fetching queries and share verified cached results. There will be token incentives for programmers who write Watchers.
