Laconic members are the only possible Validators of the Laconic Network. To become a Validator, you must complete an incentivized testnet that verifies technical competency. Furthermore, validators participate in the governance of a legal membership and must provide Know Your Customer (KYC) information to Laconic.	 	 	 

To act as a Validator, you must:

1. Serve a minimum amount of data, with a low percentage of failures or disputes (for example, become a service provider).
2. Demonstrate participation in consensus.					
3. Inject state from Ethereum into Laconic Network (for example, not only run a Watcher but run the full Laconic Stack).
